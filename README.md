# react-redux-route-saga-boilerplate

This is a create-react-app boilerplate combined with Redux/Saga/Axios/React-Router and styled with MUI and Tailwind, lint code based on AirBnb's rule, and [@udea-io/eslint-config - npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@udea-io/eslint-config). All components and pages are designed to develop with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/html/get-started/introduction). it will be designed to be the best suited with a customized Sails.js backend API server.

the goal of creating this boilerplate is to target a best practice code based on my react/react-native app development of myself from these years.

## Concept
